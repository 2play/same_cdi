# **SAME_CDI** #

SAME_CDI is a **S**ingle **A**rcade/**M**achine **E**mulator for libretro, forked from MAME libretro, which is a fork of MAME is a multi-purpose emulation framework, and compiles only the CDI driver.  The name removes the name MAME altogether, as thats what I gather the MAME folks want for a fork like this - MAMEs license is below.
